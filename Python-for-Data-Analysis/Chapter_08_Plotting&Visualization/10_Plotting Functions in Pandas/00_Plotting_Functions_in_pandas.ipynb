    "# Plotting Functions in pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "As youâ€™ve seen, matplotlib is actually a fairly low-level tool. You assemble a plot from its base components: the data display (the type of plot: line, bar, box, scatter, contour, etc.), legend, title, tick labels, and other annotations. Part of the reason for this is that in many cases the data needed to make a complete plot is spread across many objects. In pandas we have row labels, column labels, and possibly grouping information. This means that many kinds of fully-formed plots that would ordinarily require a lot of matplotlib code can be expressed in one or two concise statements. Therefore, pandas has an increasing number of high-level plotting methods for creating standard visualizations that take advantage of how data is organized in DataFrame objects."
